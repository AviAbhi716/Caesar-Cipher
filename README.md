# Caesar-Cipher Game

This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple and classic encryption technique used for encoding and decoding messages by shifting letters in the alphabet.

Features:
1. Encryption: Shifts each letter of the input message forward by a given number (shift key) in the alphabet.
2. Decryption: Shifts each letter of the input message backward by the same shift key to retrieve the original message.
3. Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters while keeping non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
4. Allows the user to encrypt or decrypt multiple times within a loop.
   
How It Works:
1. The user chooses between encryption or decryption.
2. The user enters a message to be encoded or decoded.
3. A shift number (key) is provided, determining how many places each letter moves.
4. The program performs the transformation and displays the result.
5. The user is given the option to continue or exit.
   
This program is a fun way to learn about basic cryptography and secret message encoding! üîê
